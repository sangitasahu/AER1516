skip: 0  #[pixels] Numbers of pixels to skip in the depth map. Should be >=0
depth_max: 5.0 #[m] In the depth image, points farther than depth_max, are treated as inf (i.e. along its ray (and up to that point) only unknown voxels are cleared. If doing simulation, this should be the value of pointCloudCutoffMax in the file `asus_camera_urdf.xacro`
